# Alphabetizer
This is a program I made cause I was sick of getting collections that had like a bazmillion files in them and I wanted to sort them into alphabetical folders. This is just a C# Windows Form application so just import it into your Visual Studio and run it and it should work. Just select a folder and it'll create the folders and move all the files in that folder into those folders... yes.

I may add custom folder names and such in the future. But it does the job I was trying to do earlier today so yeah.
